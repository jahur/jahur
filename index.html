							<p><strong> AI Palette helps the FMCG companies with their new product innovation. We use Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning to help FMCG companies create consumer winning products by identifying food trends in real time.</strong></p>

							<h4><strong>Project overview</strong></h4>
							<p>At the initial stage of the project I showed a few wordpress themes form themeforest. They chose one design built in Detox theme. Then they told me, they will give me a design in Adobe XD. Unfortunately they did not use any of the elements available in Detox theme.</p>
							<p>I started everything from scratch using Elementor page builder according to their design.</p>
							<h4><strong>Key points of the project</strong></h4>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Complete website</strong>
								<p>Designed each of the pages of this website.</p>
								<li><strong>Ajax filter</strong>
								<p>Developed a blog post filter using ajax which was not available in the theme.</p>
								</li>
								<li><strong>Home page featured post</strong>
								<p>Developed an element which can fetch blog posts based on their selection.</p>
								</li>
								<li><strong>Options to Redux theme option page</strong>
								<p>Edited the theme option file to add some extra fields.</p>
								</li>
								<li><strong>Custom post template</strong>
								<p>Created two new post templates according to their need. They had two separate designs for the templates. I added custom fields using <strong>ACF (Advanced Custom Fields)</strong> plugin.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>

							<p>It seems like an obvious contradiction that persons of such perfection of power should themselves require the greatest care to guard them against threatening dangers, but this is not the only contradiction revealed in the treatment of royal persons on the part of savages. These races consider it necessary to watch over their kings to see that they use their powers in the right way; they are by no means sure of their good intentions or of their conscientiousness. A strain of mistrust is mingled with the motivation of the taboo rules for the king.</p>
